      <t>This document describes two SAML entity attributes that can be used by Entities in their SAML2 metadata. One can be used to
      indicate that an Entity is operating in compliance with a specific Code of Conduct; the second attribute states the legal Jurisdiction binding the Entity.

    <section title="Introduction and Motivation">
      <t>
      	This document describes a specific SAML "entity category attribute" <xref target="SAML2EntityAttribute"/> which indicates a claim that the entity thus labelled is committed to operating in compliance with a specific version of a Code of Conduct. It is expected that, over time, there may be multiple different Codes of Conduct; they may be developed by different communities, or may be newer versions of the developed by the same community. This specification is independent of whichever CoC is being referenced in a particular instance.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      	This document also describes a second SAML "entity category attribute" <xref target="SAML2EntityAttribute"/> whose value is an assertion of the country/legal jurisdiction which binds the Entity. This should indicate the legal framework under which the SP is operating, and under which disputes would be resolved if a contract does not exist or does not specify an alternative.
      </t>
      <t>
      	These SAML entity attribute claims MAY be used by a Service provider to convince an Identity Provider that the relying party is operating in compliance with the terms of the referenced Code of Conduct. Consequently an Identity Provider might consider the risk associated with releasing personal attribute values to that Service Provider to be acceptly low. This claim represents a statement, not a legal agreement.
      </t>
      
    </section>

    <section title="Entity Attribute of CoC Compliance">
      <section title="Syntax">
        <t>
        	The value of the Name attribute on the enclosed SAML attribute is the identifier of the version of the Code of Conduct to which the Entity is committed. These values will typically be URIs. Typically, a Code of Conduct document will contain, within its text, the value to use as its "Name". There is no central Registry of these values.
        </t>
        
		<t>
			The AttributeValue of the enclosed SAML attribute is a URL. Each individual Code of Conduct MAY specify what can be retrieved by resolving this url, and should also specify what steps, if any, an Identity Provider can take to process the retrieved document (eg to further validate compliance with the specified Code of Conduct).
		</t>
		
      </section>
  
      <section title="Semantics">
        
        <t>
        	The AttributeValue of the enclosed SAML attribute is a URL which resolves to a copy of the Code of Conduct identified by the Name attribute. The URL MUST resolve to the particular "version" of the Code of Conduct identified by the Name attribute; the text of the Code of Conduct MUST NOT be modified.

          The Name of the enclosed SAML attribute is ''http://www.edugain.org/jurisdiction''.

			The AttributeValue of the enclosed SAML attribute is an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of the country, or, if that isn't sufficient to qualify the jurisdiction, an ISO 3166-2 code of the country and its subdivision (for instance, to indicate the state).

      <t>
        The presence of the Code of Conduct compliance entity attribute
        represents a series of claims (one for each attribute value) that the entity is committed to a Code of Conduct. The presence of the Jurisdiction entity attribute represents a claim that the entity is bound by the laws in a certain jurisdiction.
      </t>
        
      <t>
       Before accepting and acting on such claims, any relying party needs to establish, at a level of assurance sufficient for the
        intended use, a chain of trust concluding that the claim is justified.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Some of the elements in such a chain of trust might include:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            The integrity of the metadata delivered to the relying party, as for example
            assured by a digital signature.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the entity category attribute is carried within a signed assertion, the assertion
            itself must be evaluated.
          </t>
          <t>
            The procedures and policies of the immediate source of the metadata;
            in particular, any procedures the immediate source has with regard to aggregation
            of metadata from other sources.
          </t>
          <t>
            The policies and procedures implemented by agents along the publication path from
            the original metadata registrar: this may be determined either by examination of
            the published procedures of each agent in turn, or may be simplified if the
            entity metadata includes publication path metadata as described in the
            <xref target="SAML2MetadataDRI"/> extension.
          </t>
          <t>
            The policies and procedures implemented by the original metadata registrar.
          </t>
          <t>
            The definition of the Entity Attribute itself; in particular, any statements it makes about
            whether the value of the Entity Attribute may be self-asserted, or may only be asserted
            by particular authorities.
